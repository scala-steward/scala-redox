## [Unreleased]

## [8.0.3] - 2020-04-29

### Changed

- All Redox message models not extend sealed trait hierarchy bellow, making them an ADT
  - RedoxMessage
    - PatientRedoxMessage
      - VisitRedoxMessage
        
## [8.0.1] - 2019-11-24

### Added

- Added `Invalid` sentinel values to `DataModel` and `EventType` enums, so that
  it is possible to construct a `Meta` for any JSON message (essentially, all
  fields on `Meta` are now optional)
  
### Changed

- Swapped to using scalafmt for formatting

## [8.0.0] - 2019-08-26

### Changed

- **Breaking** Upgrade to akka-http 10.1.8

## [7.0.0] - 2019-08-22

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Upgrade to play-json 2.7.3
- Upgrade to play 2.7.3
- Upgrade to sbt 1.2.8

## [6.0.5] - 2019-05-14

### Changed

- Redox sometimes send Language value as "Unknown" when language value is explicitly not specified.
These "Unknown" values will get assigned the java.util.Locale.ROOT when deserialized.

## [6.0.4] - 2019-05-13

### Changed

- Redox sometimes send Language value as "Other" for non-ISO standard values.
These "Other" values will get assigned the java.util.Locale.ROOT when deserialized.

## [6.0.3] - 2019-04-15

### Changed

- Add MetaLike interface to OrderMessageLike (non-breaking).

## [6.0.2] - 2019-04-12

### Fixed

- MedicationsMessage had some incorrect properties:
  - MedicationsMessage.Order.Indications are now a sequence instead of an Option
  - MedicationsMessage.Visit now use Option[VisitInfo] instead of Visit
- MedicationsMessage now extend MetaLike, HasPatient and HasVisitInfo
(which are required for message models)

## [6.0.1] - 2019-04-11

### Added

- Support for Medication messages with new models for
`MedicationOrder`, `MedicationMessge` and `OrderedMedication`.

## [6.0.0] - 2019-03-28

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Renamed `CodeSet` to `Codeset` (note the lower-case `s`) to fix
  mappings from JSON, converted it into a trait, with implementations
  `BasicCodeset` and `CodesetWithName`
- **Breaking**: Converted `Observation` into a trait, with implementations
  `ProcedureObservation`, `ResultObservation`, `VitalSignObservation` and
  `FlowsheetObservation`
  - This was done to cope with the flowsheet observation not having a
    `CodeSystem`

## [5.0.0] - 2019-03-25

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Made Demographics.dob optional as it's not reliable in
  `PatientUpdate` messages.

## [4.0.0] - 2019-03-22

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Made `Contact` and `BasicPerson`'s `FirstName` and `LastName`
  optional (In Redox, these are only "possible" fields)

## [3.0.0] - 2019-01-28

### Fixed

- Added the ability to handle multiple credentials for multiple sources.

  Each source in Redox has a unique pair of key/secret credentials. If a client
  has multiple sources, this would have required creating multiple RedoxClients,
  one for each source.

  However, `RedoxClient` constructed an internal `WsClient` and an
  Akka schedule to manage the access-refresh Token lifecycle. This consumed
  unnecessary resources as each client would have created its own thread pool.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `RedoxClient` is completely redesigned to take in an external
  Http client. A secondary constructor is added for easier migration. However,
  usage is only advisable if application has a single source .
- Marked one property on the ReceiveController protected

### Added

- `RedoxTokenManager` to manage Redox tokens for multiple sources.
- Added `HttpClient` interface to allow using different http client under the
  hood.
- `ClientConfig` object standardizes the configuration values that's needed
  to be passed into RedoxClient.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-01-18

### Added

- Added a controller helper trait for responding to Redox endpoint challenges
  and validating received webhook messages

## [2.0.5] - 2018-12-12

### Fixed

- Robust parsing of non-array paths

## [2.0.1 - 2.0.4] - 2018-10-31

### Fixed

- Fixed compiler warning on non-exhaustive match

## [2.0.0] - 2018-10-31

### Removed

- Remove cross-compile code for 2.11 release as there are multiple
  incompatibilities.

## [1.6.0 - 1.6.2] - 2018-09-24

- Fixed `Locale` validation errors by introducing a strict `Language` type.

### Changed

`Patient.Demographics.Language` is changed from java.util.Local to `Language`

## [1.5.1] - 2018-09-18

### Added

- Added `CanceledEvent` field to Meta

## [1.5.0] - 2018-09-18

### Changed

- Made `VisitInfo.Patient` class an enum value

## [1.4.6] - 2018-09-04

### Added

- Added "Formatted Text" as a Order ValueType
- Handled "ST" and "RT" Order priority value via a mapping

## [1.4.5] - 2018-08-24

### Removed

- Removed HasDefaultEnum json parsing

## [1.4.4] - 2018-08-23

### Changed

- Changed Language field from String to java.util.Locale

## [1.4.3] - 2018-08-23

### Added

- Added robust parsing for primitive types.

## [1.4.2] - 2018-08-19

### Fixed

- Fixed robust parsing issue with json arrays.

## [1.4.1] - 2018-08-16

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where robust parsing fails to recover from deep errors

## [1.4.0] - 2018-08-13

### Changed

- Changes signature of `webhook` to return both potential error and results. `(Option[JsError], Option[AnyRef])`

### Removed

- Removed support for scala 2.11 (Backdated)

## [1.3.0] - 2018-08-10

- With the upgrade of `json-annotations` library. We will now assign default values to message fields
whenever parsing of that filed fails.

### Changed

- Failing to parse an `Enumeration` with `HasDefaultReads` will now fallback to a default value
and a failure being logged. (except for `SexType`, `DataModel`, `RedoxEventTypes` and `CommonVitalTypes`)

## [1.0.1 - 1.1.0] - 2018-06-28

### Changed

- Releases are now performed by CI automatically
- Cross-build Scala versions updated to the latest in each of 2.11.x/2.12.x

### Added

- Optional reducer argument to `RedoxClient.webhook`, similar to the one on the `RedoxClient` constructor

## [0.104] - 2018-06-12

### Added

- Added a constructor argument to `RedoxClient`, `reducer` which allows specifying how to reduce e.g. empty
  parts of a response before it is converted into model instances. Defaults to the current behavior, which is
  to only prune parts of a response that are strictly null.
- Added `reduceEmptySubtrees` as a method to `JsValue` (via implicits), in addition to the existing
  `reduceNullSubtrees` that prunes null objects - the difference is that the "empty" variant also considers
  arrays to be empty if they or their contents are (recursively).

## [0.103] - 2018-06-11

### Added

- Added a `HasVisitInfo` trait to mark models with a `Visit: Option[VisitInfo]` property.

## [0.100 - 0.102] - 2018-06-11

### Added

- Initial and webhook support for the `Flowsheet` data model.

## [0.99] - 2018-06-01

### Changed

- Messages were previously matched to a data type using the `Meta.DataModel` field only. However, this doesn't completely
  determine the shape of the message; for example, a message with `DataModel == Order` may not have an `Order` key,
  because `Meta.EventType` might be `GroupedOrders` (i.e. it has an `Orders` key, not an `Order` key).

  We now take both the `Meta.DataModel` and `Meta.EventType` into account when deciding how to parse a message.

- `Patient.Demographics.Sex` now defaults to a value of `Unknown`. This was previously a required value, but Redox only
  define it as "reliable" and not "required" (we've seen messages in-the-wild with `null` for this property.)

## [0.98] - 2018-05-28

### Changed

- `Insurance.Plan` changed from `InsurancePlan` to `Option[InsurancePlan]`
  - That's because the plan may be a "null subtree" (all properties null), in which case it is not guaranteed to be set
- Null subtree algorithm removes nulls from arrays
  - Previously, if null-subtree objects were wrapped in an array, the subtree removal would replace the objects with JsNull
    values, but leave them in the array (causing a later error), e.g.

    ```json
    "Orders": [
      {
        "Diagnoses": [
          {
            "Code": null,
            "Codeset": null,
            "Name": null,
            "Type": null
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    previously became

    ```json
    "Orders": [
      {
        "Diagnoses": [null]
      }
    ]
    ```

    but will now become

    ```json
    "Orders": [
      {
        "Diagnoses": []
      }
    ]
    ```

## [0.97] - 2018-05-28
